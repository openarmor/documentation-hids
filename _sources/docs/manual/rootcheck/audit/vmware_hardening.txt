VMware Infrastructure 3 Security Hardening for ESX 3.5
======================================================

OpenArmor Policy monitor can check if a system is in compliance with the
`VMware Infrastructure 3 Security Hardening guidelines for ESX 3.5 <http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vi3_security_hardening_wp.pdf>`_.
This benchmark covers the virtual machines settings for ESX 3.0 and 3.5. In addition to that, since
the ESX runs on Red Hat Linux, we also perform the `Center for Internet Security Benchmark for Red Hat Enterprise Linux <CIS_rhel.html>`_ at the same time.



Understand the test
-------------------

For every test that failed, you will receive an alert describing which section
of the benchmark that failed. For example:

.. code-block:: console

  System Audit: System Audit: VMware ESX - VM settings - Copy operation between guest and console enabled. 
  File: /vmfs/volumes/485a72e0-dd49e4f1-796c-001517761286/bart-RHEL5-svm/bart-RHEL5-svm.vmx. 
  Reference: http://theopenarmor.org/wiki/index.php/SecurityHardening_VMwareESX .


The above alert says that the specified virtual machine enables copy operations between itself and the VM console.


To receive more information about each section,
please visit `http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vi3_security_hardening_wp.pdf <http://www.vmware.com/pdf/vi3_security_hardening_wp.pdf>`_ and look for guidelines on how to solve each issue reported.

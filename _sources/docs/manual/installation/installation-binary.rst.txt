Compiling OpenArmor for a Binary Installation 
=========================================

OpenArmor is typically compiled on each system it is installed on, but this may not always be easy. 
To help in these cases there are a few methods of binary installation available. OpenArmor can be 
compiled on one system, and copied to the destination systems. This installation method still 
requires GNU make on the target system.

There are also RPM and deb packages available for some systems.



.. note:: 

    OpenArmor has very limited cross compiling facilities. Windows binaries can be built on Linux systems, 
    but binaries for other systems should be built on a system of the same OS and CPU platform.

Compiling OpenArmor for install on a second server 
----------------------------------------------

First download the OpenArmor package corresponding to the version you want to 
install and unpack it (on the system with a compiler).

.. code-block:: console 

    # wget -U OpenArmor http://theopenarmor.org/files/OpenArmor-hids-2.8.1.tar.gz
    # tar -zxvf OpenArmor-hids-latest.tar.gz 

    
Enter in the source directory of the downloaded package, and configure OpenArmor to build the ``agent`` version.
The ``make`` commands should compile the correct binaries.

.. code-block:: console 

    # cd OpenArmor-*/src
    # make setagent
    # make all
    # make build

Modify `OpenArmor-hids-*/etc/preloaded-vars.conf` to set BINARY_INSTALL to yes. 

.. code-block:: console 

    # echo "USER_BINARYINSTALL=\"y\"" >> OpenArmor-hids*/etc/preloaded-vars.conf

Finally create an OpenArmor package.

.. code-block:: console 

    # tar -cvf OpenArmor-binary.tar OpenArmor-hids*

Installation of the binary OpenArmor package 
----------------------------------------

On the target system (that does not have a C compiler) download your OpenArmor-binary.tar 
created in the steps above. 

Complete the installation by unarchiving the binary package and running ./install.sh. 

.. code-block:: console 

    # tar xfv OpenArmor-binary.tar
    # cd OpenArmor-* 
    # ./install.sh 

After following the installation prompts the install will be complete.

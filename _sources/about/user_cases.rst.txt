  *"After testing it out on several of my machines, I can officially say it.s exactly what I was looking for in an IDS: something lightweight, cross-platform, and well documented. ... This is absolutely what I was looking for in intrusion detection. Go check OpenArmor out when you get a chance."*

  *"OpenArmor is a <b>complete Host Intrusion Detection System, meant to detect any and all attempts at intrusion</b>. We reviewed OpenArmor in 2006, when it was at the 0.9 release. But even though its much larger and more complex than the other two tools, <b>OpenArmor installation is a breeze."*

  *"I heard a talk once where the presenter said the true strength of your network security comes when you take away your firewall; what happens to your network if someone adds an .Any to Any on Any Accept. rule to the top of your rulebase? Does your network fall apart and crumble? Obviously, that.s quite a blow to the defense of your network . but can you fight from one knee until reinforcements arrive? <b>One of the best tools you can get to help you out is software called OpenArmor*
  *The idea behind OpenArmor is simple . have software that watches your logs, understands what they mean, and reacts as necessary...*
  *Getting OpenArmor running is surprisingly simple, considering how powerful it is</b>. All it takes is some knowledge of Linux, and knowing what logs you want to watch. Don.t worry, there is an agent for Windows servers, too; however, the server itself runs only on Linux..."*

  *"During Defcon15 there was a new kind of contest called the "ï¿½wn the box" competition where anyone who 0wned a box got to take it home. I was over there as a speaker so I thought it might be fun to try defending a box. My box was based on Gentoo-Linux and hardened using various techniques...*
  *So the results were recently published on the DC-Homepage (http://defcon.org/) - and if you look closely there is this line saying "Most evil entry: Tatsumori (Gentoo Hardened with arp poisoning evilness)" The arp-foo was actually done using scapy, but I scripted it as an active response for OpenArmor 1.2. So part of my success to survive there (and really make people curse out while hacking) is OpenArmor.*
  *It's great modularity and easy extensibility makes creating kick-ass crazy dedicated solutions so much easier then it was ever before."*

  *"To anyone else reading this who hosts servers and is worried about getting attacked, i use http://theopenarmor.org/ which is effectively a self defence program.*
  *If you try and brute force (more than n attempts in p seconds) or portscan my machine, it simply locks you out for 24 hours by denying that IP.*
  *It has other useful features and even lets me know when it's being attacked - absolutely brilliant program and i have no hesitation in recommending it."**

  *"My company just got PCI certified (we're on our way to CISP)...*
  *Here's a run-down of the projects that I've implemented to achieve our PCI compliance...*
  *Host Intrusion Detection, File Integrity Monitor (OpenArmor): I'm using OpenArmor (http://theopenarmor.org) to monitor the individual SysLog files for perceived security issues. OpenArmor understands Snort, Cisco PIX, IPTables, and a host of others.*
  *Additionally, I have OpenArmor agents running on each of my servers (including Windoze), which report back to a central OpenArmor Server. The agents are primarily in charge of monitoring important files for changes (nice view during upgrades), and secondarily in charge of scanning for RootKits.*
  *OpenArmor can also interface with IPTables and other host-based firewalls, as a means of implementing Real-time greylisting...*

``Jul 25, 2007``

  *"Though OpenArmor-HIDS is a fairly young project .., it.s approach to intrusion detection is based on commonsense, and extremely extensible. And that is something I think we have been missing from software products these days: common-sense.*
  *Most vendors seem more inclined to add features, and a sparkly/pretty GUI, and less inclined to fix their detection*
  *engine or refine signatures (for signaturebased IDS) to help reduce false positives. Hopefully OpenArmor-HIDS will be a trend-setter in that other IDS vendors get back to their roots and use a more common-sense based approach to intrusion detection. <b>Forget the glitz and pretty graphs; just make something that works. OpenArmor-HIDS is just that....it works; and has an added bonus of working well.*

  *"I am truly impressed with OpenArmor when it comes to HIDS (Host intrusion Detection System) functions...*
  *OpenArmor is a project from Daniel B. Cid (contact at OpenArmor.net) who is the primary author of this great tool. I run OpenArmor from a single box to cluster of machines ranging in the 100s, primarily running *NIX. Although, I primarily use it for HIDS (agent) setups, recently I am starting to see a benefit in using OpenArmor for log analysis. This started with OpenArmor reporting alerts from mod_security, which I use heavily as a WAF for Web Applications... "*

  *"..*
  *I have several methods by which I achieve this, and I'm not going to advertise them all. One of the ways that I achieve proactive security monitoring and reactive system changes to cease attempts made by nasties on the internet getting access or extended information about the system, is to use a Host Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) and of all the packages that I have experienced, have stuck with, <b>and can highly recommend OpenArmor - open source, free, regularly updated, virtually bug-free and a very good ruleset.</b> I'm listed as a donor now, too :-)"*

  *"OpenArmor is a leading Intrusion Detection System for Enterprise UNIX(-like) and Windows platforms. <b>OpenArmor is, by quite a way, the most innovative and customisable IDS product I have worked with.*
  *As a result of it.s ease of customisations, the developer Daniel B. Cid, with a little bit of help from myself, have implemented supported rule-sets for my former employers. products: Zeus WebServer and ZXTM. Both products are widely deployed across many enterprise environments; adding specific rulesets for their software is one which I hope assists all fellow sysadmins tasked with running infrastructure using Zeus software.*

  *"This host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) has recently been gaining popularity among enterprise users, in part because of its high scalability. If an attack overcomes your network defenses, OpenArmor HIDS stops the attack at the host level, and it can be configured to notify the network administrator when an attack occurs. It's compatible with many firewalls and all the major operating systems."*

  *"I've selected OpenArmor HIDS as the No. 1 open source tool due to its recent rapid growth in the enterprise. OpenArmor HIDS is a rapidly evolving open source project that offers the first ever open source host intrusion detection and prevention system</b>, developed by Daniel Cid. The OpenArmor HIDS project has been gaining widespread use and is quickly being deployed within organizations around the world as a method of protecting systems at the host level after attacks have made it past network defenses.*
  *..*
  *Combined with open source Snort, OpenArmor gives administrators a 360-degree holistic view of both the network and the endpoint systems they are monitoring.*
  *..*
  *The OpenArmor rules language is incredibly flexible and powerful allowing administrators to define their own custom rules to alert on any predefined text or patterns. Its detection capabilities do not stop at rules. It includes checks via syscheck for changes to user-specified directories, integrity checks on files and directories, MD5 checksum changes, file or directory sizes, file or directory ownership, and group, file and directory permissions. More importantly, OpenArmor monitors the Windows registry, in which most trojans, spyware and backdoors are traditionally injected on Windows hosts.."*

  *"We were able to get a lot of out-of-the-box functionality," </i>says David Bianco, cybersecurity analyst for Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Va. <i>"OpenArmor immediately started parsing our firewall logs and alerting on Internet scans and probes. It's also helping track failed logins, system account changes, IDS alerts and a few other things -- all with very little work on our part."*

  *"I've used a lot of different file integrity monitoring programs (Samhain, Osiris, and Tripwire just to name a few), and I've *
  *messed with a number of different programs for log parsing and event correlation. <b>Then I found OpenArmor, which takes all of these *
  *things to  an entirely new level</b>. Now instead of having to manage multiple different software packages, I can do it in one. But *
  *that's not the  coolest thing. OpenArmor will allow you to monitor syslog and Windows event logs as well as Apache, IIS, Snort, and numerous other logs from a single location, and it has a very robust set of rules to do event correlation. If you are so inclined, *
  *you can even take advantage of the Active Response option and have OpenArmor disable accounts, drop in firewall rules, etc., etc. Plus *
  *it does file  integrity monitoring on top of it all..."*

  *"GREAT SOFTWARE*

  *First, thanks for publishing this software. the OpenArmor HIDS project looks great so far. *
  *It fills a serious need. I do PCI (payment card industry) consulting, and every client *
  *needs to have a centralized log server and file integrity solution. The windows/unix *
  *ability is perfect. This could save people a lot of money and get used.*

  *Also, the installation was really fast."*

  *It's works without problems. I've use Nessus to testing it, and, it's wonderful.*
  *Iptables and hosts.deny was use without troubles, and Nessus can't report some trouble or else.*

  *Great.*

  *I've been running this on my FreeBSD server for 2 months now, and it's been fantastic. *
  *If I so much as modify one file in /etc I get an email telling me about it. It watches *
  *a ton of other things, and is very configurable, but don't be deterred, it runs fine on *
  *the default settings while you learn the system, and install is a snap. While the above *
  *HOWTO looks good, I installed w/o any problems from the OpenArmor install doc:*

  *http://theopenarmor.org/en/manual.html#install*

  *I would like to see this project get more attention, as computer security should not end at the firewall or snort.*

  *It has even come in handy with the departure of an employee in the past week who tried *

OpenArmor and Splunk


Here's how I configured OpenArmor to send alerts to Splunk:

In OpenArmor.conf add a syslog_output block specifying your Splunk system IP address and the port your network input is listening on:

  <syslog_output>
    <server>172.10.2.3</server>
    <port>10002</port>
  </syslog_output>


Now you need to enable the syslog_output module and restart OpenArmor:

  #/var/OpenArmor/bin/OpenArmor-control enable client-syslog
  #/var/OpenArmor/bin/OpenArmor-control restart

On restart you'll see OpenArmor-csyslogd starting up. Now for the Splunk side.


You have a few options on how to receive OpenArmor alerts. The two options I've looked at are a standard Splunk network input or syslog-ng. I would suggest using syslog-ng and either the FIFO or file destination method. This way when you need to restart Splunk, which can be rather frequent, you won't lose events like you would with the Splunk network input. The Splunk for OpenArmor application uses the network input method for simplicity.


Grab the Splunk for OpenArmor app which can be found here: http://www.splunkbase.com/apps/All/Security/app:Splunk+for+OpenArmor#.



The OpenArmor app for  is currently designed for SPLUNK 3.x. There is a work around. Install it in  SPLUNK, then use the SPLUNK Search tool, and the OpenArmor dashboards are all there. (it works) 

One other addition: 

When you edit the opt/splunk/etc/system/local/inputs.conf  file
Splunk is happier when you add the host listing on line 3 of the file below, else it thinks you have two OpenArmor servers...


[default]

host = mymachine

mymachine=10.1.100.141

[udp://10.1.100.141:10002]

disabled=false

sourcetype=OpenArmor


The .spl is actually just a .tgz so all you need to do is extract it to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/.


Make sure you update any local or network firewalls that this communication is traversing and then restart Splunk.

  #$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk restart

If you have any tweaks or improvements to configuration or the Splunk for OpenArmor app please let me know! (canuck.eh[at]gmail[dot]com)

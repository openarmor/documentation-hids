manage_agents
=============

manage_agents is available in two versions:

- a version for OpenArmor server installations
- a version for OpenArmor agent installations

The purpose of manage_agents is to provide an easy-to-use interface to handle authentication
keys for OpenArmor agents. These authentication keys are required for secure (encrypted and
authenticated) communication between the OpenArmor server and its affiliated agent instances.

OpenArmor Architecture
==================

OpenArmor is composed of multiple pieces. It has a central manager for monitoring 
and receiving information from agents, syslog, databases, and from 
agentless devices.


Manager (or Server)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The manager is the central piece of the OpenArmor deployment. It stores the file 
integrity checking databases, the logs, events, and system auditing entries. 
All the rules, decoders, and major configuration options are stored centrally in 
the manager; making it easy to administer even a large number of agents.

Agents connect to the server on port 1514/udp. Communication to this port must be
allowed for agents to communicate with the server.

.. note::

   The manager may be called the OpenArmor server, or even just server in this documentation.

Agents
~~~~~~

The agent is a small program, or collection of programs, installed on the systems 
to be monitored. The agent will collect information and forward 
it to the manager for analysis and correlation. Some information is collected in 
real time, others periodically. It has a very small memory and CPU 
footprint by default, not affecting the system's usage.

*Agent security*: It runs with a low privilege user (generally created during the 
installation) and inside a chroot jail isolated from the system. Most of the 
agent configuration can be pushed from the manager. 

.. note::

   OpenArmor can only be installed as an agent on Microsoft Windows platforms.
   These systems will require an OpenArmor server, running on Linux or another
   unix-like system.

Agentless
~~~~~~~~~
For systems that an agent cannot be installed on, the agentless support may allow 
integrity checks to be performed. Agentless scans can be used 
to monitor firewalls, routers, and even Unix systems. 


Virtualization/VMware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenArmor allows you to install the agent on the guest operating systems. 
It may also be installed inside some versions of VMWare ESX, but this 
may cause support issues. With the agent installed inside VMware ESX you can get 
alerts about when a VM guest is being installed, removed, started, etc. It 
also monitors logins, logouts and errors inside the ESX server. In addition to 
that, OpenArmor performs the Center for Internet Security (CIS) checks for VMware, 
alerting if there is any insecure configuration option enabled or any other issue.

Firewalls, switches and routers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenArmor can receive and analyze syslog events from a large variety of firewalls, 
switches and routers. It supports all Cisco routers, Cisco PIX, Cisco FWSM, 
Cisco ASA, Juniper Routers, Netscreen firewall, Checkpoint and many others.

This diagram shows the central manager receiving events from the agents and 
system logs from remote devices. When something is detected, active responses 
can be executed and the admin is notified.

Obviously, that.s quite a blow to the defense of your network . but can you fight from one knee until reinforcements arrive? &lt;b&gt;One of the best tools you can get to help you out is software called OpenArmor</em>

OpenArmor HIDS is a rapidly evolving open source project that offers the first ever open source host intrusion detection and prevention system&lt;/b&gt;, developed by Daniel Cid. The OpenArmor HIDS project has been gaining widespread use and is quickly being deployed within organizations around the world as a method of protecting systems at the host level after attacks have made it past network defenses.</em>
<em>..</em>
<em>Combined with open source Snort, OpenArmor gives administrators a 360-degree holistic view of both the network and the endpoint systems they are monitoring.</em>
<em>..</em>
<em>The OpenArmor rules language is incredibly flexible and powerful allowing administrators to define their own custom rules to alert on any predefined text or patterns. Its detection capabilities do not stop at rules. It includes checks via syscheck for changes to user-specified directories, integrity checks on files and directories, MD5 checksum changes, file or directory sizes, file or directory ownership, and group, file and directory permissions. More importantly, OpenArmor monitors the Windows registry, in which most trojans, spyware and backdoors are traditionally injected on Windows hosts..&#8221;</em></p>

<div><p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;ve used a lot of different file integrity monitoring programs (Samhain, Osiris, and Tripwire just to name a few), and I&#8217;ve *
*messed with a number of different programs for log parsing and event correlation. &lt;b&gt;Then I found OpenArmor, which takes all of these *
*things to  an entirely new level&lt;/b&gt;. Now instead of having to manage multiple different software packages, I can do it in one. But *
*that&#8217;s not the  coolest thing. OpenArmor will allow you to monitor syslog and Windows event logs as well as Apache, IIS, Snort, and numerous other logs from a single location, and it has a very robust set of rules to do event correlation. If you are so inclined, *
*you can even take advantage of the Active Response option and have OpenArmor disable accounts, drop in firewall rules, etc., etc. Plus *
*it does file  integrity monitoring on top of it all...&#8221;</em></p>

<div><p><em>&#8220;GREAT SOFTWARE</em></p>
<p><em>First, thanks for publishing this software. the OpenArmor HIDS project looks great so far. *
*It fills a serious need. I do PCI (payment card industry) consulting, and every client *
*needs to have a centralized log server and file integrity solution. The windows/unix *
*ability is perfect. This could save people a lot of money and get used.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, the installation was really fast.&#8221;</em></p>

<p><em>I&#8217;ve testing this hids on a Debian (kernel 2.6.17) and on a Red Hat Enterprise 3 (kernel 2.4).</em>

<div><p><em>&#8220;I started using OpenArmor after watching the SANS webcast about it. I tried it for</em>
<em>a few days in a demo environment and then decided to deploy it on all my network.</em>
<em>I had a few Linux servers (Redhat), one Solaris system and a dozen Windows desktops.</em>
<em>I am glad I deployed it.. Just after the install, OpenArmor found some rootkits on one of</em>
<em>my linux servers that had an FTP server installed and the presence of a some suspicious</em>
<a href="#id6"><span class="problematic" id="id7">*</span></a>files on the web server. *</p>
<p><em>After some investigation I found that the web server was</em>

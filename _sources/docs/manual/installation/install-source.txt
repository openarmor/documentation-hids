Manager/Agent Installation
==========================


Installation of OpenArmor HIDS is very simple, the ``install.sh`` shell script automating most of it.
There are a few questions to be answered before the installation will occur, one of the most 
important being which type of installation is desired.
It is important to choose the correct installation type: server, agent, local, or hybrid.
More information on thse can be found on the `OpenArmor Architecture page <../OpenArmor-architecture.html>`_.

.. note::

    In the following installation the commands follow the ``#``. 
    Everything else is either comments out output. 

1. Download the latest version and verify its checksum.

.. include:: getOpenArmor.trst

2. Extract the compressed package and run the ``install.sh`` script. It will guide you 
   through the installation and compile the source (not shown).

    .. code-block:: console 

        # tar -zxvf OpenArmor-hids-*.tar.gz (or gunzip -d; tar -xvf)
        # cd OpenArmor-hids-* 
        # ./install.sh

3. The OpenArmor manager listens on UDP port 1514. Any firewall sbetween the agents and 
   the manager will need to allow this traffic.

4. The server, agent, and hybrid installations will require additional configuration. 
   More information can be found on the `Managing the agents page <../agent/agent-management.html>`_.

5. Start OpenArmor HIDS by running the following command:

    .. code-block:: console 

        # /var/OpenArmor/bin/OpenArmor-control start

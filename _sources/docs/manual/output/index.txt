Overview:
---------

OpenArmor includes a number of ways to send alerts to other systems or applications. 
Syslog, email, and sending the alerts to an SQL database are the typical methods.
These output methods send only alerts, not full log data.
Since the agents do not generate alerts, these options are server side only.

.. _manual_rule_decoder_dir:

Directory path loading of rules and decoders
============================================

To allow whole directories of files to be loaded as decoders, lists, or rules
by OpenArmor-anaylistd.

Use case
--------

Greatly simplifies working with decoders as there can be as many files as needed.
Also will make packaging of rules and decoders a simple unzip/untar and restart
operation. This will also greatly reduce the amount of code needed to manage
the upgrade scripts of OpenArmor.

Details
-------

Syntax for OpenArmor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Directory loading is done in alphabetical form. This is much like init.d
where the use of numeric prefixes on file names can affect the order of
loading. Example of file names and the order they would be loaded:

#. 00_sshd_rules.xml
#. 01_local_sshd_rules.xml
#. 99_shun_rules.xml

Directory loading 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The basic format for selection of rules file is as follows. This will load all
files in the rules dir that match the regex ``_rules.xml$``.

.. code-block:: xml

    <OpenArmor_config>
        <rules>
            <rule_dir pattern="_rules.xml">rules</rule_dir>

The pattern is optional and defaults to _rules.xml for rules loading so this
could be writen as:

.. code-block:: xml 

    <OpenArmor_config>
        <rules>
            <rule_dir>rules</rule_dir>

Order of the directives in OpenArmor.conf is still respected, and duplicate files
will not be loaded. In the following example 00_setup_rules.xml is always
loaded first, and will *NOT* be loaded a second time by the rule_dir
directive.

.. code-block:: xml 

    <OpenArmor_config>
        <rules>
            <include>rules/00_setup_rules.xml</include>
            <rule_dir>rules</rule_dir>

For full details on all the Syntax see :xml:`rule_dir` and :xml:`decoder_dir`

Compete Examples of syntax 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an example where the decoders and rules have been broken out into
subdirectories.

* rules/ 

    * 00_rules_config.xml 
    * 50_apache_rules.xml
    * 50_arpwatch_rules.xml
    * plugins/ 

        * 50_wimax_rules.xml
        * 50_wimax_decoders.xml 

* etc/

    * decoder.xml 
    * local_decoder.xml 


.. code-block:: xml 

    <OpenArmor_config>
        <rules>
            <decoder>etc/decoder.xml</decoder>
            <decoder_dir>rules/plugins</decoder_dir>

            <rule>rules/rules/00_rules_config.xml</rule>
            <rule_dir pattern=".xml$">rules/</rule_dir>
            <rule_dir>rules/plugins</rule_dir>
        </rules>  
    </OpenArmor_config>

**Whats New**

* SQLite support for syscheck
    * PR #1091 - whitelist for files in sqlite DB
    * PR #1364 - add some ifdefs for the md5 whitelist database (USE_SQLITE)

* Update cJSON 1.7.0
    * #1351

* Add Pagerduty Active response
    * #1302

* OpenArmor-authd 

    * #890 / #873 - Dichotomic search to add agents with authd
    * #1154 / #1210 - password support
    * #1161 - avoid IP duplication, time limit agent deletion with duplicate IP, and option for re-using an agent ID
    * #1190 - Exit handler for authd to delete PID file
    * #1208 - add cipher configuration support

* zlib update to 1.2.11
    * #1198

* OpenArmor-agent selinux module
    * #1193

* windows agent
    * #1170 - add agent-auth.exe support

    * tcp support for agent communications
    * #1162

* GeoIP support in rules and events
    * #840 - Support in alerts
    * #927 - add geoip support to JSON output analysisd.geoip_jsonout=0
    * #929 - Modify rule token different_geoip rule to different_srcgeoip
    * #984 - fix some geoIP bugs
    * #1108 - decoder fixes

* Slack support
    * #947 - Escape the '.' in the grep for '.ALERTLAST' #947
    * #959 - silent curl in OpenArmor-slack

* Decoders filename attribute
    * #915 - A few fixes, but most importantly the ability to set the filename attribute from a decoder. This will help create automated pipelines for FIM Verification. I currently need to compare FIM events against 1) Puppet, 2) GIT, and 3) RPM. This patch allows FIM events to be intercepted by my custom FIM Verification script, which generates logging events which OpenArmor can read and turn back into an event with the filename attribute set.

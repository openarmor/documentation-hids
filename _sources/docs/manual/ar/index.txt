Active Response
###############

The Active Response feature within OpenArmor can run applications on an agent or server in response to certain triggers.
These triggers can be specific alerts, alert levels, or rule groups.

The active response framework is also what allows an OpenArmor administrator to start a syscheck scan or restart OpenArmor on a remote agent.

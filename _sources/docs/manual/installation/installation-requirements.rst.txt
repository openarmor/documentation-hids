.. _install_req:

Installation requirements
==========================

For UNIX systems, OpenArmor only requires gnu make, gcc, and libc.
OpenSSL is a suggested, but optional, prerequisite. 
However, you always have the option to pre-compile
it on one system and move the binaries to the final box.

PCRE2
-----

.. versionadded:: 3.3

PCRE2 support has been added to OpenArmor v3.3. The build system can either use the system's PCRE2 libraries,
or the necessary bits can be built as part of the installation process.

.. versionadded:: 3.4

As of v3.4 the default build process has set `PCRE2_SYSTEM`, and expects pcre2 to be installed on the system.
On many Linux systems the necessary packages would be `dev` or `devel` packages specifically.

Alternatively, OpenArmor can build and use pcre2 without installing the packages.
To do this the `pcre2-10.32` sources must be installed in `src/external`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd OpenArmor-hids-*
   $ wget https://ftp.pcre.org/pub/pcre/pcre2-10.32.tar.gz
   $ tar xzf pcre2-10.32.tar.gz -C src/external

If you use the `pcre2-10.32` sources, set the `PCRE2_SYSTEM` variable to no:

.. code-block:: console

   # cd OpenArmor-hids-*
   # PCRE2_SYSTEM=no ./install.sh

To use the system's PCRE2, set the `PCRE2_SYSTEM` variable to yes:

.. code-block:: console

   # cd OpenArmor-hids-*
   # PCRE2_SYSTEM=yes ./install.sh

zlib
----

`zlib <https://www.zlib.net/>`_ is included with OpenArmor in `src/external/zlib-1.2.11`. In previous
versions this included version was used by default during the build process, but this changed to 
using the system zlib. Ensure the correct zlib development packages are installed.

To use the included version of zlib, simply set `ZLIB_SYSTEM` to `no`:

.. code-block:: console

   # cd OpenArmor-hids-*
   # ZLIB_SYSTEM=no ./install.sh

libevent
--------

.. versionadded:: 3.5

`libevent <http://libevent.org/>`_ was added for `OpenArmor-agentd` and `OpenArmor-maild`. A development package
for this should be installed on the system.

RedHat / Centos / Fedora / Amazon Linux
---------------------------------------

Step 1) At a minimum, the following packages should be installed:

.. code-block:: console

   yum install zlib-devel pcre2-devel make gcc sqlite-devel openssl-devel libevent-devel systemd-devel

Step 2) For optional database support add thepackage mysql-devel and/or postgresql-devel packages

.. code-block:: console

   yum install mysql-devel postgresql-devel


Step 3) Run the installation script

.. code-block:: console

   ./install.sh



Ubuntu / Debian
---------------

At a minimum, the following packages should be installed:

.. code-block:: console

   apt-get install build-essential make zlib1g-dev libpcre2-dev libevent-dev libssl-dev

On Debian 10 Buster, `zlib` could be `libz`.

.. code-block:: console

   apt-get install libz-dev

On Ubuntu you will need the *build-essential* package in order to
compile and install OpenArmor.

To install the package run the following command.

.. code-block:: console

   apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev

To use the system's pcre2 libraries, install the libpcre2 development package:

.. code-block:: console

   apt-get install libpcre2-dev

If database support is needed *mysql-dev* or *postgresql-dev* should be
installed. Run the following command to install these packages.

.. code-block:: console 

    apt-get install mysql-dev postgresql-dev

On Debian 10 Buster the following packages may be installed for MySQL/MariaDB support:

.. code-block:: console

   apt-get install default-libmysqlclient-dev libmariadb-dev-compat 

To use the SQLite features, the `libsqlite3-dev` package is necessary.

.. versionadded:: 3.0

.. code-block:: console

   apt-get install libsqlite3-dev



OpenSuse
--------

The zlib development package should be installed:

.. code-block:: console

   zypper install zlib-devel

To use the system's pcre2 libraries, add the pcre2 development package:

.. code-block:: console

   zypper install pcre2-devel

If database support is needed the package mysql-devel and/or postgresql-devel will
need to be installed.

.. code-block:: console

   zypper install postgresql-devel mysql-devel

FreeBSD
-------

If you want to build and install OpenArmor on FreeBSD you can work together with
its `FreeBSD Ports Collection <https://www.freebsd.org/ports>`_.

There you can find and setup **OpenArmor-hids-agent**, **OpenArmor-hids-local** or
**OpenArmor-hids-server**.

If you want to build and install only the the required dependencies to run an
OpenArmor server/manager, without installing it:

.. code-block:: console

   # cd /usr/ports/security/OpenArmor-hids-server
   # make

If you want to install this particular port, you should run ``make install``.

FreeBSD also offers pre-compiled packages for OpenArmor and all its dependencies. If you
want to install them you must work with
`pkg <https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/pkgng-intro.html>`_.

OpenBSD
-------

As OpenBSD also has its own `OpenBSD Ports Collection <https://www.openbsd.org/faq/ports/ports.html>`_,
you can build and install OpenArmor using it if you want.

It only offers **security/OpenArmor-hids**, so:

.. code-block:: console

   cd /usr/ports/security/OpenArmor-hids
   make

Just like the previous example with FreeBSD, if you want to install it all (not just the
dependencies) you must run ``make install`` instead. Another option would be using
`pkg_add <https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq15.html>`_.

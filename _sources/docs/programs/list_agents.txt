list_agents
===========

OpenArmor HIDS list_agents: List available agents.

list_agents is only available on OpenArmor servers or local mode installations. 
It can be used to retrieve

- a list of all OpenArmor agents that successfully connected to the server in the past
- a list of all OpenArmor agents currently connected to the server
- a list of all OpenArmor agents that were connected to the server in the past but are currently not connected.

If an agent was added via the :ref:`manage_agents` tool but has not yet been connected to the server, it will not show up in the output of list_agents.

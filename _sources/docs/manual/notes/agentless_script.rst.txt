Agentless Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All scripts that work with OpenArmor agentless security monitoring use stdout for communication and reporting to the OpenArmor server. This makes writing scripts for OpenArmor simple as you do not need to do anything more then print or echo to stdout. The format of the output does need to meet the OpenArmor specification, but that is a very simple thing to do.

Before we move to the specification details I need to explain that OpenArmor agentless runs to different types of scripts. Namely the following:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Type           | Description                                                                                                                                               |
+===============+===========================================================================================================================================================+
| periodic_diff | Scripts output data to the OpenArmor agentless process that will then be compared to past runs and if there are differences an OpenArmor alert will be generated. |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| periodic      | Scripts output controlled messages to the OpenArmor agentless process that will then be processed accordingly.                                                |
+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Periodic diff Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The output for periodic_diff is very simple, any and all output after the agentless command .STORE: now. and before the next OpenArmor Command will be stored and compared for differences. This type of script is mostly used for hardware devices such as Cisco IOS, Juniper JunOS, and other products.

Scripts that use the periodic_diff make use of the following commands:

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Command  | Description                                                                                                                                        |
+==========+====================================================================================================================================================+
| INFO:    | The string following INFO will be logged to /var/OpenArmor/logs/OpenArmor.log by OpenArmor for debugging.                                                      |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ERROR:   | Error needs to be reported. The string following this command is forwarded to the OpenArmor manager, and the OpenArmor process closes down the script.     |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| STORE:   | All the lines that follows this command will be added stored and compared to previous runs of the script.                                          |
+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Here is an example of a periodic_diff script that comes with OpenArmor. (Please note with all agentless scripts you must be in the root of the OpenArmor install for them to function correctly.)

  INFO: Finished.


In this example above the script would store the contents between ``STORE: now`` and ``INFO: Finished.`` If this is the first time that OpenArmor agentless has run this command no alerts would be generated and the contents would have been saved for later comparisons. If OpenArmor agentless has a stored copy from a previous execution it will compare the files and if there are any differences it will generate an alert.

Periodic Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The periodic specification has more options and gives more control to the script writer on what actions OpenArmor will take. Once again stdout is used for communication so script writing is easy.

+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Command  | Description                                                                                                                                    |
+==========+================================================================================================================================================+
| INFO:    | The string following INFO will be logged to /var/OpenArmor/logs/OpenArmor.log by OpenArmor for debugging.                                                  |
+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ERROR:   | Error needs to be reported. The string following this command is forwarded to the OpenArmor manager, and the OpenArmor process closes down the script. |
+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| FWD:     | The string following FWD is a colon delimited list of stats on a given file.                                                                   |
+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| LOG:     | The string following LOG: will be passed into OpenArmor-analysisd and processed like all other log messages.                                       |
+----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Example of real FWD: command.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

  FWD: 19419:600:0:0:fb30de5b02029950ae05885a3d407c8c:017cd6118cdc166ee8eba8af1b7fdad6763203d3 ./.bash_history


The Fields break down in to the following

+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Field                                     | Description                     |
+===========================================+=================================+
| FWD:                                      | The OpenArmor Command               |
+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| 19419                                     | Total size of file, in bytes    |
+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| 600                                       | Access rights of file in octal  |
+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| 0                                         | User ID of file owner           |
+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| 0                                         | Group ID of file owner          |
+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| fb30de5b02029950ae05885a3d407c8c          | MD5 Hash of file                |
+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| 017cd6118cdc166ee8eba8af1b7fdad6763203d3  | SHA1 Hash of file               |
+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| ./.bash_history                           | Path and name of file           |
+-------------------------------------------+---------------------------------+

Using this format OpenArmor can store the information about a file and then in the future run compare that they are the same. If for some reason they are not the same an alert will be generated. Here is an example of a password change on a linux system:

.. code-block:: console

**Release Notes**

  The great JSON-in-ing has begun! New features in this release focus on extending JSON output support to control commands like agent_control, syscheck_control, and rootcheck_control. Additional extensions add support for archives.log in native json format, and improving the alert.json output. This release also also brings some much needed enhancements to OpenArmor-authd to streamline the agent registration experience (thanks nhatking16591!), Bob-Andrews continues on major auditing improvements plus support for Solaris 11. 

  We'd like to thank all the great contributors (named and anonymous!) who continue to improve OpenArmor and support our community. We'd also like to welcome all our new contributors to OpenArmor on this release. They have helped us on bug testing, documentation, new features, rules, compliance checks, code and more. There are no small contributions to a project like OpenArmor, and we continue to thrive with your support. Special thanks to security researchers A.P. and S.S. for their audit of the OpenArmor project, your work has greatly benefited the community. 

  If you're interested in joining our team, or just interacting with us on slack email us at: invite@OpenArmor.net

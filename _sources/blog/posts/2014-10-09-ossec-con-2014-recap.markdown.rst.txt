====================
OpenArmor CON 2014 Recap
====================

OpenArmor CON 2014 was held in Cork Ireland this year to promote OpenArmor in
EMEA where we have many users. This year we had several members of the
current OpenArmor Team speak to our audience.

Jeremy Rossi, currently the OpenArmor Development Manager, told us about
some of the OpenArmor open source history and shared the statistics on
number of OpenArmor contributions over the years. The good news is there are
more lines of code and programmers contributing them than ever before.
Jeremy did all the heavy lifting to move OpenArmor over to Github which has
really encouraged more people to work on it.

Santiago Gonzales joined us again this year reviewed his work using
Cuckoo in conjunction with OpenArmor to detect malware that shows up on
Windows based systems.

New OpenArmor Team member and author of `Instant OpenArmor Host-based Intrusion
Detection System Brad
Lhotsky <https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/instant-OpenArmor-host-based-intrusion-detection-system-instant>`__
talked to us about what he has done with OpenArmor to help automate his
security operations at Booking.com.

Barry O’Meara from AlienVault shared his experiences with using OpenArmor
with Amazon CloudTrail to provide intrusion detection for AWS instances.

I gave a talk on using Elasticsearch to manage OpenArmor security alerts. I
have posted all the slides from this and previous OpenArmor conferences in
the `Documentation section <http://theopenarmor.org/?page_id=1146>`__ of
this site.

Finally, Cork was simply beautiful. The weather was great and the hotel
accommodations at the
`Gresham-Metropole <http://www.gresham-hotels-cork.com/>`__ were superb.
thanks again to our good friends at
`AlienVault <https://www.alienvault.com/>`__ for sponsoring OpenArmor CON
2014. And thanks to all of our conference attendees.

Look for the conference next year to be held at one of the major Unix
conferences – to be determined. Thanks to all who attended.

See you next year.

Agents 
====== 

There are two types of agents within OpenArmor: installable agents and agentless 
agents.  Installable agents are installed on hosts, and they report back to 
a central OpenArmor server via the OpenArmor encrypted message protocol.  Agentless 
agents require no installation on remote hosts. They are processes initiated 
from the OpenArmor manager, which gather information from remote systems, and use 
any RPC method (e.g. ssh, snmp rdp, wmi).

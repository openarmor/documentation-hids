OpenArmor Log Management with Elasticsearch
=======================================

Among the many useful features of OpenArmor is its capability to send alerts
to any system that can consume syslog data. This makes it easy to
combine OpenArmor with a number of 3rd party SIEMs to store, search and
visualize security events. `Splunk for
OpenArmor <http://apps.splunk.com/app/300/>`_ is one such system that works
on top of the Splunk platform.

Splunk can be expensive though, particularly if you collect a lot of log
data. So Iâ€™ve been working on a solution for collecting OpenArmor security
alerts based on Elasticsearch that provides a cost effective alternative
to Splunk.

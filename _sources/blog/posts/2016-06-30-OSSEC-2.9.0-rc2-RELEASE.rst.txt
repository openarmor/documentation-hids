===============
OpenArmor 2.9.0 RC2
===============
This release marks our second release candidate for OpenArmor 2.9 after some great input from our testers out there. 
Assuming no issues are reported, this release will become the final OpenArmor release. 

Now is when we need really your help! As a community driven project, we need all the testing a release this size can get. Let us know in the OpenArmor mailing list, Github bug tracker, the official OpenArmor irc channel (#OpenArmor irc.freenode.net) or on our new Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/OpenArmorhids/
